## Reflection

Took me an unnecessarily long time as I was grappling with how I should best structure my codes. In the end, I decided to just churn out codes and refactor along the way. In hindsight, and to quote from Din Djarin: this is the way.

### What Went Well 
- The design
- Sidebar open and close functionality
- I think I handled all page updates quite well (though please correct me if you encounter a bug!)
- On the logic side, I think I implemented some of the SOLID principles to a good standard (again, CMIIW)

### What could be improved
- HTML element creations -- I am 100% there's a better way of creating elements/components via JS. I think this is where React and other Front-end frameworks play a role.
- Although I believe SOLID is implemented somewhat well on the logic side, it is quite the opposite for every other part of the project. Especially on the components part.
- The choice between using a class or factory functions. I'm not fully sure whether the way I implemented my class and factory functions are correct/appropriate.
- I could've done away with all the separate JS components and instead use good-old HTML to make things simpler, but I wanted to try what it's like working fully in JS. Turns out, it gets tedious really fast without the help of a framework.

### Takeaway
- Until I learn a frontend framework, use as much HTML and as little JS components.
- Don't fuss too much about the best way of doing things. Churn out ugly codes and refactor along the way.
- Probably set a deadline so I know what to prioritize.
